<div class="p1">

    <p>
      TripApp is a travel planner that shows hotels, restaurant reviews, attractions, and other travel content.
It also includes interactive chat that can be used between travelers. 

Simple to you use, it can help you organize your trip day per day, communicate with your friends, and organize your friend’s ideas.
</p>

<ul class="description">
  <li><b>The problem:</b> Traveling in groups is great but the organization can be very intimidating. Lack of communication, stress, overwhelmed, a lot of people will just follow the group anxious to have to deal with everyone’s ideas. </li>
<br></br>
<li><b>The solution:</b> TripApp is developed to decrease this amount of stress by helping with the organization and the communication of group travelers into the app. You can chat with your friends, plan your trip, and vote for your friend’s ideas. Communication becomes then easier and everyone can now participate.</li>

<h3>FINDING THE WHYS</h3>
<h2>What are the problems?</h2>

<div class="p1">

  <p>Travel as become huge so I did some research of travel background to understand and be able to characterize my goal.
I then creating some basic research questions to help me focus on the main idea of the project.
To answer my research questions I will use Interviews and Surveys as a methodology.
I Defined an ideal participant but I still wanted be openminded.
Schedule (When, how and where?)
</p>
</div>

<h3>FIRST STEP</h3>
<h2>Who travels often and for who a travel planner will help?</h2>

<img src="images/interviews.png" alt="interviews" class="interviews">
<div class="p1">

<p>I interviewed 8 person. I went out in to talk to strangers, talked to my friends, and people at my work.
With my interviews, I discovered that there is two type of users. People who travel for fun and people who travel for work.
</p>
</div>
<h4>User Persona</h4>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h3>DEFINE & IDEATE</h3>
<h2>Understanding the problem</h2>

<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<div class="p1">

<p class="problemstatement">Travel websites are designed to plan your trip only specifically (hotel sites, activities,
  restaurants...) However, I realized that it is hard for people to organize, communicate and plan itineraries with all those different
tools, which is causing frustration and time consuming. How might we elaborate a tool that will helped
with communication and itineraries planner into one?</p>

</div>

<h4>Storyboard</h4>

<div class="img1">

<br></br>


<h3>PROTOTYPING & TESTING</h3>
<h2>Key Solutions</h2>

<div class="p1">

<p>I started to sketch my User flow. It was very messy and not too clear but I had an idea of where I was going. It helped me define my main steps of the app.
  I then created a digital user flow which was more clear. Because it was more clear, I also changed some steps that made more sense to me.

</p>
<p>Creating the user flow for “Create a trip” was hard because it’s a lot of possibilities and options. However, it’s also where my main focus on my app is which is: planning, communication, and voting ideas.
</p>
</div>

<h4>User Flow</h4>

<br></br>
<br></br>

<h4>Wireframes</h4>

<img src="images/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe">


<div class="p1">

<p>Using a sketch wireframe gave me more perspective of how my app is going to look like. I started visualizing my app and it made more sense to me. By sketching, I also had to change a few things from my user flow. It made sense on the user flow but not on the sketching.
</p>

</div>

<img src="images/wireframe2.png" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe">

<div class="p1">

<p>This is where everything come to life. It was very pleasant to make the digital wireframes based on my sketches. I also changed a few things that made more sense on digital and I added a lot of things that I didn’t thought about while I was sketching the wireframes.
</p>
</div>


<h4>Hi-fi Wireframes</h4>

<div class="img2">

<img src="images/HI-FI1.png" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe1">
<img src="images/hI-FI2.png" alt="wireframe" class="wireframe2">
</div>


<div class="p1">
<p>I then created my new iOS Wireframes. From the data that I got from my test I was able to add some buttons to be more clear and change some outline and design to understand better the functions of my app. Making iOS wireframes made my app more clear and readable.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Prototype</h4>

<img src="TripAppPrototype.gif" alt="gif" class="gif">

<div class="p1">
<p>I then created a prototype with In Vision to see if my functions makes sense and If my new wireframes answers the users issues from my last wireframes.

<h3>Final Thought</h3>
<h2>What have I learned?</h2>

<img src="images/mockup2.png" alt="mockup" class="mockup">

<div class="p1">

<p>UX Researcher want to understand the user, understand the problem, feel the problem, and emphasize with the user. I thought that was very interesting and deep to create a persona with a picture and a personality because by creating this “person” you start to care more about the person’s problem. Like your kid. I also think that I could’ve done better with more time and more research.
This project was a learning experience and made me realize that you can always do better. 
The key is two be able to step out of your shoes and be open-minded.
